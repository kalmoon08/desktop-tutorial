		 <h2>Story Excerpt</h2>
		 
		 <div>
			 <p class="se">"Ah, Himari-san," at his teacher's words, the girl on top of Karma tensed up. "It was quite risky of you to jump after Karma-kun like that. Who knows what would have happened to you two if I wasn't there."

				 She—<i>Himari</i> nervously laughed as she raised her head to look at their teacher. "Ne~ Koro-sensei, please look over this." She hung her head, Karma hearing her mutter under her breath, "I'd love to die right now, please."

Without further delay, the yellow octopus brought the two back onto the cliff. Nagisa helped the brunette steady herself while Karma was left to himself.

"Welp, I guess it's time for me to go!" She announced, looking at her wrist which, by the way, did not have a watch on it. She points in the direction where the stairs lead down the mountain. "I wouldn't want to ruin this beautiful moment of bonding any more than I already have, now would I?"

She turned towards Koro-sensei, "I came by to say that I'll be absent for a few days, Koro-sensei! Mirai will tell you more about it~" She walked off without a reply, before abruptly stopping in her tracks. Her body rigidly turned around as she asked, "You won't tell Mirai what happened here, will you?"

"Of course I will—Hey!" After hearing what their teacher had to say, she ran for it. "W-Wait, Himari-san! You'll have a punishment when you come back, you know!"

The girl left as fast as she appeared.</p>
